## 👨‍💻 About me

Thanks for checking out my profile. I'm a software engineer, human, and all-round curious person. I follow problems where they lead, love thinking laterally about risk, and value trust and kindness.

I'm proud of having built systems and cultures that have enabled startups to scale to profitability. Comfortable both at altitude and in the weeds. I seem to have a career hazard of doing my best work when I discover a system for the first time that's already on fire.

Some facts:

- 🏡 Near Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom - in the beautiful Dartmoor National Park
- 💼 Staff Software Engineer currently at [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com) - making sense of millions of events in our data warehouse

- 🔍 I value environments where teams ship continuously and learn from real data. Fragile systems are a choice. Teams outrun heroes.
